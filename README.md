A Galaga like game made with DragonRuby

Enjoy some 80s style arcade action with this Galaga like game made with DragonRuby. Originally I was going to build a how it was made video with this but for now it is the edge of my skill level so I am not comfortable teaching it. 

It fun though and I hope you enjoy playing it.
